#4 Final Project:
The focus of your final project is up to you. It should incorporate tools, techniques, and insights from the course. It can be something you have worked on already within the run of this course or from another course, but should build significantly upon the work that you have already accomplished. 


It should be noted that documentation is extremely prized and that great work is often lost in poor documentation. Take the time to capture high quality photographs and videos of your project. If your project is interactive, make sure to take videos of yourself or a model demonstrating the interaction.
